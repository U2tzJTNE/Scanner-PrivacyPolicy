# Scanner-PrivacyPolicy

## Why do we need your camera permission?
Because of Android's permission policy, the app must be accessed after the user grants the camera permission, so we need your authorization.

## How do we protect your data?
We will process your personal data as required by law. I am a Chinese and I will abide by China's data security laws and other national legislation. I promise that the software will not share any data in the app to other applications.

## Contact information
If you still have any question about your privacy, you can contact us. And we will reply to you as soon as possible.
