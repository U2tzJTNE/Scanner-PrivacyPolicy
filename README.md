# Scanner-PrivacyPolicy

## Why do we need your camera permissions?
Due to Android's permission mechanism, the camera can only be accessed after the user grants the corresponding permission, so for the normal operation of the program, we need your authorization.

## Why do we need your storage permissions?
It is also limited by the permission mechanism. When you want to manually select a picture or save the picture locally, we need the storage permission to operate normally. Of course, we will apply for this permission only when you use this function.

## How do we protect your data?
We will abide by China's data security laws and other national legislation to ensure that the software will not share any data in the application with other applications, and that the software can be used normally without internet connection.

## Contact information
If you still have any question about your privacy, you can contact us. And we will reply to you as soon as possible.
